# KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

The objective of this project is to identify the factors that will make a Kickstarter campaign for an American Theatre Play “Fever” with an estimated budget of $10,000, become a success. The secondary focus of the project is to study and present the risk factors in raising funds for a British Musical with an estimated budget of £4,000.

Over 4000 kickstarter campaigns and their related parameters have been statistical analyzed to uncover hidden crowdfunding trends contributing to a campaign's success or failure.
