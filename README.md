# KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

The objective of this project is to identify the factors that will make a Kickstarter campaign for an American Theatre Play “Fever” with an estimated budget of $10,000, become a success. The secondary focus of the project is to study and present the risk factors in raising funds for a British Musical with an estimated budget of £4,000. Over 4000 kickstarter campaigns and their related parameters have been statistically analyzed to uncover hidden crowdfunding trends contributing to a campaign's success or failure.

# *How successful have US Theatre campaigns been?*

Our analysis shows that Theatre projects in the US have received a **fairly good response** from crowdfunding sources. The success rate has a decent margin over failure rate.

# *Can we say the same about Theatre Plays in the US?*

Yes, we can..! In fact, Theatre Play campaigns seem to be **far more successful** than other kinds of Theatre campaigns.

# *Is our goal realistic?*

We cannot underestimate the impact Goals can have on the outcome of a campaign. It is important to be realistic, so we have to choose a Goal that aligns with past trends. It is evident from the below chart that successful campaigns have had an average Goal of $5000. More importantly, did you notice that failed campaigns have had an average Goal of $10000? This sends out a red flag for our campaign estimated at a budget of $10000! We have to come way down and settle for a figure around $5000 otherwise we are running into the risk of failing.

# *Alright then! Shall we get started?*

Hold on! Not yet.. Based on past trends, the month of **May** is a clear winner of Launch Dates. It has seen a surprisingly high number of successful campaigns. However launching a campaign in *June* wouldn't be so bad either.

# An insight into British Musicals

It's a no-brainer that British Musicals with a goal around £2000 stand a better chance as opposed to those with higher goals. Although our budget is not unrealistic, it would be wise to cut down some expenses and stay closer to the winning trend.

We have a list of British musicals that played in Edinburgh that our client was more interested in. So we dug a little deeper to understand these campaigns better. Here's what we found! Their average Goal was £2100 and they were all launched around the months May, June & July.

# So, here's what I recommend..

* Crowdfunding trends tip in the favor of *Theatre plays in the US*. To eliminate probable risk factors, it is highly recommended that the **Goal** be brought down to **$5000** and that we launch the campaign in **May** (*or June at the latest*).
* Although the Launch Date trends for *Musicals* are similar in *The Great Britain*, they have been receiving lesser support monetarily speaking. A Musical campaign with a **Goal of £2100** launched in **May or June** is undoubtedly a recipe for success.
