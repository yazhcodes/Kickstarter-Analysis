# KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

The objective of this project is to identify the factors that will make a Kickstarter campaign for an American Theatre Play “Fever” with an estimated budget of $10,000, become a success. The secondary focus of the project is to study and present the risk factors in raising funds for a British Musical with an estimated budget of £4,000. Over 4000 kickstarter campaigns and their related parameters have been statistical analyzed to uncover hidden crowdfunding trends contributing to a campaign's success or failure.

# *How successful have Theatre campaigns been?*

Our analysis shows that Theatre projects receive a **fairly good response** by crowdfunding sources. The success rate has a decent margin over failure rate.

# *Alright then! When should we launch the campaign?*

Based on trends, the month of **May** is a clear winner. It has seen a surprisingly high number of successful campaigns. However launching a campaign in *June* wouldn't be so bad either.
